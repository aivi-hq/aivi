### Minor Changes

- [#13](https://github.com/aivi-hq/aivi/pull/13) [`9f4d557`](https://github.com/aivi-hq/aivi/commit/9f4d557467d1efc928d211ab8f9d5ad19a094fc2) Thanks [@RWOverdijk](https://github.com/RWOverdijk)! - `aivi install discord|slack|NPM-SPEC` adds a plugin to the server home and lets it configure itself, replacing the manual config entry for the channels. npm installs the package into `<home>/app` (`--save-exact`, so `aivi update` carries it along), then the plugin's own `./setup` entry runs: it prints how to create the platform app, asks for the tokens (hidden), verifies each against the platform before anything is written — Discord's application id is derived from the bot, Slack's tokens answer `auth.test` and `apps.connections.open` — and writes its `modules.*` block into `config.json` and its secrets into `.env` (0600, never echoed; a write that leaves the config unloadable is restored). Then aivi restarts and the command ends in a verified truth: the module's own state from `/v1/status` ("Discord is running."). An already configured module is never clobbered, a foreground server is never restarted behind the operator's back, and a package without a `./setup` export is still installed, told as having no setup command. The contract is one subpath — any package exporting `./setup` with a default function installs this way; the plumbing (`aivi plugin setup SPEC`, not person-facing) and the write helpers (`writeConfigBlock`, `upsertEnvFile`) live in the app and core packages.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#2](https://github.com/aivi-hq/aivi/pull/2) [`6a44b29`](https://github.com/aivi-hq/aivi/commit/6a44b29d5b9d04b30a613debad1fefe21a9c114c) Thanks [@RWOverdijk](https://github.com/RWOverdijk)! - Roles arrive: a person carries an open string array of roles (`operator`
  manages people and maintenance; new people default `member`), the store
  migration grants `operator` to everyone who existed, and `whoami` answers the
  real roles instead of the hardcoded stub. People management over the API —
  listing, creating (optionally with roles: `aivi people create NAME --role
  operator`) and minting tokens for — now requires an operator bearer; the
  store-direct path on the server itself stays the operator at the console.
  Wider per-operation enforcement lands with the ops dispatcher
  (docs/plans/operator-api.md).

- [#2](https://github.com/aivi-hq/aivi/pull/2) [`05ec0d6`](https://github.com/aivi-hq/aivi/commit/05ec0d68a50c678c32882d6ad720db60cb8e01c7) Thanks [@RWOverdijk](https://github.com/RWOverdijk)! - The CLI can run the server in the background and update it. `aivi service
  install|uninstall|start|stop|restart|status|logs` wrap a per-user LaunchAgent
  (macOS) or systemd user unit (Linux). `aivi update` resolves the channel from
  `config.json` (`update.channel`, default stable), provisions `runtime/` Node
  when the target demands it, stops the server, installs via npm — whose peer
  resolution pins a plugin at "disabled: no compatible release" when its range
  excludes the new host — restarts and probes `/health`. `aivi upgrade` updates
  the CLI through npm. Channel plugins now declare `@aivi/host` as a
  peerDependency, making npm the compatibility resolver.
