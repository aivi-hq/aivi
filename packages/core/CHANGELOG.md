# @aivi/core

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#16](https://github.com/aivi-hq/aivi/pull/16) [`5d865bf`](https://github.com/aivi-hq/aivi/commit/5d865bfcea07feb096370b4fb0a27d8ea831433c) Thanks [@RWOverdijk](https://github.com/RWOverdijk)! - The CLI's face: both CLIs (the thin client and the server app) move onto
  commander for parsing, routing and help. Help is grouped by kind and themed in
  the brand colors, every command answers `aivi <command> --help` for itself,
  flags are declared per command (an unknown flag in the wrong place is an
  error), and a typo'd command is answered with the nearest real one. The
  wordmark banner prints on a terminal; pipes and `NO_COLOR` keep plain text, so
  stdout stays a machine contract. Colors come from Node's built-in
  `util.styleText` in the same hex palette the logs use; the Node floor moves to
  26.1.0 for its hex support. Command bodies are extracted into
  `packages/app/src/commands/` grouped by category.

- [#16](https://github.com/aivi-hq/aivi/pull/16) [`bc1f731`](https://github.com/aivi-hq/aivi/commit/bc1f7318b2a4a68ee514eb0d4f280c32c1acc252) Thanks [@RWOverdijk](https://github.com/RWOverdijk)! - A plugin can extend the operator CLI: where `./setup` is the install-time
  subpath, `./cli` is the runtime one — a package that default-exports a
  `PluginCliCommand` from `./cli` is mounted into the server CLI under Channels
  whenever the package is installed, with parsing and help owned by the app's
  commander and `run` receiving a `PluginCliContext` (loaded config, store
  bracket, the shared JSON stdout, the host poke, one prompt). `aivi discord`,
  `aivi slack` and `aivi linear` now come from their own packages through that
  contract. The brand color moves to `#3B82FF` — the wordmark and the help terms
  in the CLI, and the `aivi·host` log category, share it.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#13](https://github.com/aivi-hq/aivi/pull/13) [`9f4d557`](https://github.com/aivi-hq/aivi/commit/9f4d557467d1efc928d211ab8f9d5ad19a094fc2) Thanks [@RWOverdijk](https://github.com/RWOverdijk)! - `aivi install discord|slack|NPM-SPEC` adds a plugin to the server home and lets it configure itself, replacing the manual config entry for the channels. npm installs the package into `<home>/app` (`--save-exact`, so `aivi update` carries it along), then the plugin's own `./setup` entry runs: it prints how to create the platform app, asks for the tokens (hidden), verifies each against the platform before anything is written — Discord's application id is derived from the bot, Slack's tokens answer `auth.test` and `apps.connections.open` — and writes its `modules.*` block into `config.json` and its secrets into `.env` (0600, never echoed; a write that leaves the config unloadable is restored). Then aivi restarts and the command ends in a verified truth: the module's own state from `/v1/status` ("Discord is running."). An already configured module is never clobbered, a foreground server is never restarted behind the operator's back, and a package without a `./setup` export is still installed, told as having no setup command. The contract is one subpath — any package exporting `./setup` with a default function installs this way; the plumbing (`aivi plugin setup SPEC`, not person-facing) and the write helpers (`writeConfigBlock`, `upsertEnvFile`) live in the app and core packages.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#2](https://github.com/aivi-hq/aivi/pull/2) [`6a44b29`](https://github.com/aivi-hq/aivi/commit/6a44b29d5b9d04b30a613debad1fefe21a9c114c) Thanks [@RWOverdijk](https://github.com/RWOverdijk)! - Roles arrive: a person carries an open string array of roles (`operator`
  manages people and maintenance; new people default `member`), the store
  migration grants `operator` to everyone who existed, and `whoami` answers the
  real roles instead of the hardcoded stub. People management over the API —
  listing, creating (optionally with roles: `aivi people create NAME --role
  operator`) and minting tokens for — now requires an operator bearer; the
  store-direct path on the server itself stays the operator at the console.
  Wider per-operation enforcement lands with the ops dispatcher
  (docs/plans/operator-api.md).

- [#2](https://github.com/aivi-hq/aivi/pull/2) [`05ec0d6`](https://github.com/aivi-hq/aivi/commit/05ec0d68a50c678c32882d6ad720db60cb8e01c7) Thanks [@RWOverdijk](https://github.com/RWOverdijk)! - The CLI can run the server in the background and update it. `aivi service
  install|uninstall|start|stop|restart|status|logs` wrap a per-user LaunchAgent
  (macOS) or systemd user unit (Linux). `aivi update` resolves the channel from
  `config.json` (`update.channel`, default stable), provisions `runtime/` Node
  when the target demands it, stops the server, installs via npm — whose peer
  resolution pins a plugin at "disabled: no compatible release" when its range
  excludes the new host — restarts and probes `/health`. `aivi upgrade` updates
  the CLI through npm. Channel plugins now declare `@aivi/host` as a
  peerDependency, making npm the compatibility resolver.
