### Minor Changes

- [#16](https://github.com/aivi-hq/aivi/pull/16) [`bc1f731`](https://github.com/aivi-hq/aivi/commit/bc1f7318b2a4a68ee514eb0d4f280c32c1acc252) Thanks [@RWOverdijk](https://github.com/RWOverdijk)! - A plugin can extend the operator CLI: where `./setup` is the install-time
  subpath, `./cli` is the runtime one — a package that default-exports a
  `PluginCliCommand` from `./cli` is mounted into the server CLI under Channels
  whenever the package is installed, with parsing and help owned by the app's
  commander and `run` receiving a `PluginCliContext` (loaded config, store
  bracket, the shared JSON stdout, the host poke, one prompt). `aivi discord`,
  `aivi slack` and `aivi linear` now come from their own packages through that
  contract. The brand color moves to `#3B82FF` — the wordmark and the help terms
  in the CLI, and the `aivi·host` log category, share it.

### Minor Changes

- [#2](https://github.com/aivi-hq/aivi/pull/2) [`05ec0d6`](https://github.com/aivi-hq/aivi/commit/05ec0d68a50c678c32882d6ad720db60cb8e01c7) Thanks [@RWOverdijk](https://github.com/RWOverdijk)! - The CLI can run the server in the background and update it. `aivi service
  install|uninstall|start|stop|restart|status|logs` wrap a per-user LaunchAgent
  (macOS) or systemd user unit (Linux). `aivi update` resolves the channel from
  `config.json` (`update.channel`, default stable), provisions `runtime/` Node
  when the target demands it, stops the server, installs via npm — whose peer
  resolution pins a plugin at "disabled: no compatible release" when its range
  excludes the new host — restarts and probes `/health`. `aivi upgrade` updates
  the CLI through npm. Channel plugins now declare `@aivi/host` as a
  peerDependency, making npm the compatibility resolver.
