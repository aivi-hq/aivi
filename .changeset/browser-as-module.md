The browser is now a composed module like the channels, not a host resource. It claims its own `aivi_browser` descriptor at the `tools` door at start and releases it at stop, and the host serves that claim to the OpenCode plugin like any other tool. The `/v1/browser` endpoint, the `browser` field on host services and resources, and the `HostClient.browser` method are gone — the host holds no browser concept at all. `aivi install browser` now ends in the same verified truth as any other module: "Browser is running."
